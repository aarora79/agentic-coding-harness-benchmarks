"""Pre-flight helper for the end-to-end benchmark orchestrator.

Two checks, each answering a question that is cheap to ask now and expensive to
discover mid-run:

* ``--check`` / ``--clear`` enumerate the artifact directories a SWE benchmark
  run would write to, for a given dataset and model, and either report which
  already exist (so a headless run does not stall on the /swe2 skill's overwrite
  prompt) or clear them.
* ``--check-repos`` confirms every repository in the dataset can be reached at
  its pinned ref, before a single task runs. The harness clones per task, so
  without this a bad credential or a ref that does not exist fails once per
  task, hours into a batch, with an opaque ``git clone failed``. This matters
  most for private repositories on GitHub Enterprise Server, where the failure
  is usually a missing credential helper entry or an untrusted internal CA.

The directory layout mirrors the harness exactly -- it reuses the dataset
loader, ``model_to_slug`` (the folder-name normalization), and ``_repo_name``
(the repo-basename derivation) rather than re-deriving any of them here, so this
helper and the harness can never disagree about where artifacts land.

Run from the ``benchmarks/`` directory:

    uv run scripts/preflight_check.py --dataset dataset/mcp-gateway-registry.yaml \
        --model qwen3.6-35b --check
    uv run scripts/preflight_check.py --dataset dataset/mcp-gateway-registry.yaml \
        --model qwen3.6-35b --clear
    uv run scripts/preflight_check.py --dataset dataset/my-team.yaml --check-repos

Exit codes: 0 = all clear, 2 = artifact folders exist and need clearing
(``--check`` only), 1 = an error (bad dataset, bad args, or an unreachable
repository).
